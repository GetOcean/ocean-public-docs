2. To power __off__ your Ocean, __hold the power button for two seconds__.
3. To perform a HARD SHUTDOWN, __hold the power button for ten seconds until the red lights disappear__.

# Charging the Ocean

There are a number of different options for charging the Ocean.

### Use a USB port

Plug your Ocean into a wall-socket mounted USB port.  These will generally charge the Ocean much more quickly than a laptop USB port.

### Use a Wireless Charging Pad

Place your Ocean on a Qi wireless charging pad until the pad indicates that it is successfully charging the Ocean.

To perform a full power-cycle of the Ocean, insert a paperclip into the pin-hole next to the micro USB port.
