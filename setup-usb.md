title: Setup an Ocean over USB

Ocean is a computer running the [Linux operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux).  The Ocean is set up to function like a traditional Linux server, in that you do not interact with the Ocean via a screen or mouse.  Instead, you connect to the device with a remote terminal over a network.

However, since our device does not contain a direct ethernet port, the method for doing this involves a USB connection.  Ocean is intended to be used wirelessly, so you should only need to use the USB connection once, when setting up the Ocean for the first time.
