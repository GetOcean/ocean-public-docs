This guide assumes you have set up your Ocean and connected it to a WiFi network.  If you haven't done that, go back to section on [setting up your Ocean with USB]({{ site.baseurl }}/setup-usb-osx) and complete all the steps there.

Remember to make a note of your Ocean's IP address for this section!

For Mac and Linux, you can use the `ssh` program to remotely connect to your Ocean.

- [Connect to your Ocean with ssh on Linux]({{ site.baseurl }}/connect-with-ssh-linux)
- [Connect to your Ocean with ssh on OSX]({{ site.baseurl }}/connect-with-ssh-osx)

For Windows, some more preparation may be required:

- [Connect to your Ocean with ssh on Windows]({{ site.baseurl }}/connect-with-ssh-windows)
