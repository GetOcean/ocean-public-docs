At this point, you should be able to connect to your Ocean with the `ssh` program.  In another terminal window, type the following (replace the IP address with the IP address you were given by the Ocean WiFi setup program):

    ssh root@10.0.30.64

You will be prompted to enter your password:

    root@10.0.30.64's password:

Type in the same password you specified in Step 5.  If it you entered the password correctly, you should see the following output:
