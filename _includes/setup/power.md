Hold the top button on the top panel of the Ocean, in the middle of the blue logo, for at least two seconds.  

When the Ocean powers on, two red lights will begin glowing on the internal panel, and a green lightshow will begin at the bottom right hand corner of the case.  The power button contains a small LED light that will glow white once the OS is ready to talk to your computer using the `screen` program.

Plug the micro-USB connector to your Ocean, and then plug the standard USB connector to your computer.
