A list of useful guides and tutorials for getting the most out of your Ocean.

### Setup a static web server

It's very easy to set up a web server on your Ocean that can serve static HTML files.  This guide explains how to do it.

- [Set up a static web server on your Ocean]({{ site.baseurl }}/setup-simple-webserver)


### Add Another WiFi Network

A wifi setup tool is already installed by default on all Oceans.

- [Use `wifi-setup` to Add Another WiFi Network]({{ site.baseurl }}/wifi-setup-tool)

You can also add WiFi networks manually by editing the `wpa_supplicant` config files.
